# GitHub Profile Setup Guide

## 🎯 Live Statistics Setup

Your GitHub profile now includes live statistics that update automatically! Here's what's included and how to set up additional features:

### ✅ Already Working (No Setup Required)

### 🔧 Optional: WakaTime Integration Setup

To enable coding time tracking in your profile:

1. **Create a WakaTime account** at [wakatime.com](https://wakatime.com)
2. **Install WakaTime plugin** in your code editors (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
3. **Get your WakaTime API key** from your [WakaTime settings](https://wakatime.com/settings/api-key)
4. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub profile repository settings
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `WAKATIME_API_KEY`: Your WakaTime API key
     - `GH_TOKEN`: A GitHub personal access token with repo permissions

### 📊 What the WakaTime Integration Adds
- Weekly coding time breakdown
- Programming languages usage
- Operating systems used
- Code editors used
- Projects worked on

### 🎨 Customization Options
All statistics use the consistent "Tokyo Night" theme for a professional look. You can modify colors and themes by editing the URLs in the README.md file.

### 🔍 Troubleshooting
- If WakaTime stats don't appear, ensure the secrets are properly set
- Statistics may take a few minutes to load initially
- GitHub API has rate limits, so stats might occasionally show placeholder data
